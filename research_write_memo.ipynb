The web page predicts four hot trends in artificial intelligence for the year 2024, such as customized chatbots, generative video, AI-generated election disinformation, and AI-powered drug discovery. It also reviews the performance of its predictions for 2023 and the challenges and opportunities of AI in various industries and domains. The year 2023 saw a flurry of AI product launches, policy debates, and research breakthroughs. Learn about the rise and fall of generative AI, the flaws and biases of language models, the existential risks of AI, and the new rules for responsible AI development. This year's AI Index — a 500-page report tracking 2023's worldwide trends in AI — is out.. The index is an independent initiative at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI), led by the AI Index Steering Committee, an interdisciplinary group of experts from across academia and industry.
